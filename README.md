- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DemidSergeev
- I'm learning **Software Engineering** at Bonch-Bruevich SPbSUT and have finished second year of bachelor program. 
- Some of my current interests: **SQL, PyQt6, Machine Learning**.

As for summer 2024, I'm developing a pet-project called **TimerApp**. It is, obviously, a timer application, which comes handy for workouts and education sessions almost every day.

In TimerApp, I'm getting familiar with PyQt6 GUI library and SQL (through SQLite). I plan to include voice control features for more convenience.
